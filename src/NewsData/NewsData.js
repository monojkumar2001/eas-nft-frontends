        description:`New York, NY – June 5, 2023 – Ethereum Address Service (“EAS”) is thrilled to announce the launch of its ground-breaking platform where the world’s addresses are being mapped as NFT-based digital rights.

        EAS NFTs are the keys to unlock value in the digital world. With EAS, NFT collectors build digital address collections and participate in the monetization of the data associated with buying and trading. William Corbett, Founder of EAS, said, “We envision a future where every real-world address and point of interest has an associated EAS NFT. EAS serves as the platform to monetize and manage these new digital address rights and drive price appreciation for NFT buyers.”
        
        Ethereum Address Service NFTs will generate royalties and revenue from three primary use cases: (1) Gaming & Mapping, in which EAS NFT owners win real cash and prizes by building unique collections of addresses and neighborhoods through the EAS proprietary game called Address Quest™, (2) Market Intelligence, in which the buying and selling of EAS NFTs generates unique real-time data that is aggregated and monetized, providing valuable market intelligence to real estate developers and owners, investors, brokers, appraisers, lenders, consumer behavior and data analysts, and many more, and (3) Liquid Pricing Comparables, in which EAS NFTs serve as a transparent and affordable liquid pricing comparable to real-world addresses and their associated property, creating a new digitally-based data set that does not currently exist in the real-estate market.
        
        “Coming from a background of traditional real-estate and physical assets, I am most excited about the transparent digital representation these assets can take on the blockchain, and most notably, how EAS can bring new avenues for the interpretation and commercialization of the unique data associated with these new digital assets,” said Mr. Corbett. “We are only scratching the surface of how Web3 technology, and specifically NFTs, can transform the world in which we live. I believe in the next decade Web3-related applications will emerge as a dominant force in the representation of our physical addresses and associated content, like property and auto deeds, title, health data and much more.”`,
